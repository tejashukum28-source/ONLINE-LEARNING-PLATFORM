An Online Learning Platform is a web application where students can learn through videos, lessons, quizzes, and progress tracking. The main goal of this task is to create a simple and student-friendly system where users can register, log in, and access different courses easily. Each course can include video lectures, written lesson content, and quizzes to check the student’s understanding. A good learning platform should feel smooth, fast, and easy to use, similar to popular platforms like Coursera or Udemy. In this project, user authentication is very important because it ensures that only registered students can access learning content securely. Another key feature is media streaming, which means videos should play smoothly without buffering, and the platform should support easy video access. Data storage is also essential because the platform must store course details, lesson materials, quiz questions, student answers, and progress information. For development, we can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, or React.js for a more advanced and interactive user interface. For the backend, Node.js with Express.js is commonly used to handle APIs, user login, course management, quizzes, and progress tracking. For the database, MongoDB is a good option because it works well with Node.js and stores data in a flexible format. Tools like bcrypt are used to encrypt passwords, and JWT (JSON Web Token) is used to manage secure login sessions. The best editor platform for this task is Visual Studio Code because it supports both frontend and backend coding, and tools like Postman help in testing backend APIs. This project is applicable in schools, colleges, coaching centers, corporate training platforms, and online education websites. Since online learning is growing rapidly, developing this type of platform is highly useful and also improves full-stack development skills by combining authentication, media handling, and database management into one real-world application.
